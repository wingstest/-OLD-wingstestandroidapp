# Wings
Android app for Wings and other GECA events

## ApiService class

Contains endpoint urls for connecting to rest api. 

For example: http://157.230.83.171/api/customer/registrations/

In the above url, api/customer/registrations is the endpoint.

## ApiServiceBuilder

Contains BASE_URL. This class is almost always same for any retrofit app.

For example: http://157.230.83.171/ is the BASE_URL
